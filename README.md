## Chris Whitehouse
I'm an aspiring software developer, looking to pivot from managerial, commercial and analytical roles in the energy sector to a software consultancy.

Having built a career to date largely off the back of being 'good at excel', I can already demonstrate great analytical, commercial, and managerial capabilities with a small dose of technical development work, and algorithmic thinking.

With a recent investment in self-reflection, intrinsically evaluating what I do and don't enjoy, I came to realise, much of what I draw most satisfaction from in the workplace is creative problem solving with technology. Working with others to solve complex technical challenges, and then implementing, with a strong sense of absorption or 'flow'. This, in tandem with my growth mindset and love of continuous learning, pointed towards a career in software developoment.

Extrinsically, when I look around at the most innovative companies, those solving the most interesting problems, it is the companies who have technoclogy at their heart. It is these companies, that I want to work. To lend my enthusiasm, and dedication, to solving complex challenges with technologuy.

Values: integrity, growth, discipline, connection, health, progress

Behaviours: inquisitive, conscientious, coaching, friendly, focused

## Skills

#### Critical Thinking

Critical thinking is my core competence, and the skill I have leaned on most heavily throughout my academic studies, and career to date. The ability to deconstruct a problem, understand, and evaluate the constituent parts, and then think logically and clearly, to arrive at potential solutions.

I have applied this skill in a braod range of scopes; from techncial challenges such as evaluating the best way to caluclate a price or valuation, through to commerical strategy review, and even human centred challenges focused on getting the best out of a team. 


#### Communication and Team Working

As I've grown throughout my career, the importance of communication for great teamwork, has become increasingly clear to me. Whether that's as an analyst, with the ability to succintly communcate upwards business insight, or as a manager with the ability to listen, understand, and guide, or as a team member, willing to support a team mate. I have particpated, contributed and built small teams.
