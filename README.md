#### I am a software developer at the beginning of a new career, seeking to pivot from managerial, commercial and analytical roles in the energy sector to a software consultancy. 

Motivated by solving complex problems with technology, and with a deep-rooted love of learning, I am committed to the technical challenge of becoming a professional software engineer. In addition, my extensive prior commercial experience has enabled me to become adept at communication, teamwork, and project management.
